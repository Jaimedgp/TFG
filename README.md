In this dissertation we have studied the characteristics of the optical frequency combs in semiconductor lasers generated by gain-switching and optical injection. A program has been developed to solve rate equations by implementing a numerical model. These rate equations present terms of stochastic noise, being necessary to use methods of integration of stochastic differential equations for their resolution. 

In the first part of the work, the study of the simulation of the solitary semiconductor laser has been carried out, analyzing the results for the laser in continuous wave and with gain-switching. In the case of the laser in gain-switching, the optical frequency combs have been characterized according to the amplitude $$V_{RF}$$ and the frequency $$f_R$$ of the injected current. The creation and destruction of combs has been observed as the amplitude was increased, as well as a greater irregularity for low frequencies.

In the following parts the generation of optical frequency combs has been analyzed by means of optical injection from a second laser, characterized by the injected power $$P_{Iny}$$ and the detuning between both lasers' frequency $$\delta\nu$$. First, the case of optical injection without gain-switching has been studied, going on to study the combination of both methods. The model has allowed to determine the different dynamic regions for different injections, being able to identify regions with period doubling and Hopf bifurcations.
